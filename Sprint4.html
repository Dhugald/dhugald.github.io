Sprint 4, I'm leader This sprint the goal is to get the database properly connected to the site, I need to properly implement CRUD to the cars database and be able to get data from the other databases.

Taylor and Anthony need to create pages to display the outputted data.

All the pages linked correctly, data is being displayed. We need to remove links from the old site that are no longer needed, we need to display the pages better like the forms to add a car or edit the car.
