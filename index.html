Reflection
<br>
Today we were introduced to the course, we were given a task to find the 4 values and the 12 principles of the Agile manifesto.
Split into a group with Ant, Taylor and myself Ant found the 4 key values and wrote them down and Taylor and I tried to write about the principles but failed to finish them all as we ran out of time.
The next task was to start going through the Laravel module on the moodle, I started out by watching the first video then installed the programs from the 2nd part. 
I spent a lot of time catching up with others and probably could have got more done.

Spent to much time helping another group get their site up, didn’t get the task done but made some pretty decent progress with Ant. Next class I’m going to focus on just getting the task done.

Decided as a group to restart the project, spent the class working out the Laravel forms and managed to get a page up and running, I’m going to do more research into CRUD apps to workout where I’m going wrong with my app.

<h1>Sprint 1.</h1>
<br>
3/08/2020
<br>
8am – 10am
<br>
Today we started our project, I am currently the Sprint leader, I gave Anthony the task of creating the basic website and the create ccount page, Taylor was given the task to start the layout page. I linked up the pages and started on a login page, The layout page is setup for all the pages to look identical.
I’m going to find out more about the forms to create an account and log in using said account. I’ll take what I find and report it to Taylor and Anthony in our inbetween classes meeting.

Today we researched into CRUD apps, we need to be able to add users to our database and work from that to  be able to login, add games, add highscores etc etc
I don’t know much about databases and I know nothing about the CRUD I’m going to look at videos and articles about these and try to figure out where to go from here.

<br>
After researching CRUD and databases I began work with Anthony on the account creation page being able to enter values into our form and get routes set up. Grayson helped us set up the database and we worked on getting data posted.

8am – 10am
<br>
Taylors bus didn’t show up today so Anthony and I spent the lesson working on posting data to the site and we were successful, Taylor worked on the Nav bar so that we could get to the other pages on the site without having to type the route.
Anthony and I were successful in posting to the database. The groups next step is to plan a meeting time with Adon and workout what features we want to add into the site for the next sprint. 
I think that we did pretty good in the first sprint seeing as none of us were familiar with this style of work, next sprint we will spend more time planning the work with our client.
