Reflection
<br>
Today we were introduced to the course, we were given a task to find the 4 values and the 12 principles of the Agile manifesto.
Split into a group with Ant, Taylor and myself Ant found the 4 key values and wrote them down and Taylor and I tried to write about the principles but failed to finish them all as we ran out of time.
The next task was to start going through the Laravel module on the moodle, I started out by watching the first video then installed the programs from the 2nd part. 
I spent a lot of time catching up with others and probably could have got more done.

Spent to much time helping another group get their site up, didn’t get the task done but made some pretty decent progress with Ant. Next class I’m going to focus on just getting the task done.

Decided as a group to restart the project, spent the class working out the Laravel forms and managed to get a page up and running, I’m going to do more research into CRUD apps to workout where I’m going wrong with my app.
