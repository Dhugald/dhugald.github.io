Dales day, we worked on recreating our site in order to include proper login auth rather than having to add all the code into our old site.
I need to find out more on the laravel created auth login and register forms.

<br>
weekend 29-31/08/2020
<br>
Merged the sprint branch to master, tried to deploy to the mariadb but found many merge errors proventing this, in the future as a group we need to check these merges so that we dont get this again.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall individual sprint reflection
<br>
<br>
What did I do well? - Working out how to deploy the site to MariaDB
<br>
What could I do better? - Next time I wont deploy the site from my laptop as it took much longer than it would have from the polytech, I also want to check the merges more thoroughly.
<br>
What did I learn? - Laravel has very helpful features to help with users and pages.
<br>
What do I still need to learn? - I need to learn how to take advantage of these features that Laravel has, such as the login and users.
<br>
<br>
<br>
What the group achieved.
<br>
As a group we restarted our site to begin to implement login and user creation properly using the laravel auth. 
<br>
<br>
Agile Principles.
